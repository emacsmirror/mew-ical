How to setup
===============
You need to have the following elisp code at least to get this working.

(eval-after-load "mew"
  '(progn
     (require 'mew-ical)
     (setq mew-ical-server-uri "http://server.name/path/to/put/ical/")
     (setq mew-ical-home-uri "http://server.name/for/ical")
     (setq mew-ical-user "user"))) ;; if any authentication is required to put ical

If you want to look at iCalendar prior to other messages in
the multipart body, you may want to add:

(setq mew-mime-multipart-alternative-list '("Text/Calendar" "Text/Plain"))

or something like that.
